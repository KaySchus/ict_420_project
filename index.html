            <p>
                There is no definitive answer to what craft you should select, at the end of the day all are equally valid and the choice is a personal one. 
                That said, when considering a craft it can be important to consider several facets such as - 
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Cost - How much will getting started with this new craft cost you?</li>
                <li>Supplies - Do I know what I need? Do I already own any or all of the needed tools?</li>
                <li>Difficulty - Not all crafts or projects require the same user skill.</li>
                <li>Desire - No hobby works unless you want to do it, the most important factor is what you want!</li>

                <h2>Why practice yarn crafts?</h2>
            </header>

            <p>
                Diving into yarn crafts is about more than just making a cozy scarf or a quirky amigurumi—it’s a genuine investment in your well-being. 
                Whether you’re knitting, crocheting, or tufting, the rhythmic, repetitive motions create a "flow state" that naturally lowers cortisol and quiets a busy mind. 
                Beyond the stress relief, there’s a unique sense of pride in turning a simple string of fiber into a tangible, functional piece of art. 
                It’s a hobby that sharpens your focus, encourages patience, and leaves you with something beautiful to show for your "me-time."
