            </header>

            <p>
                Knitting is a method of creating fabric by using two or more needles to pull loops of yarn through other loops. 
                Knitting keeps a whole row of "live" stitches on the needle at once, if a stitch falls off, it can "run" or "ladder" down the fabric, which is why knitters are so protective of their needles!

            </header>

            <p>
                The debate over whether knitting is "harder" than crochet usually boils down to how your brain (and hands) prefer to work. 
                Crochet is often considered more beginner-friendly because you only deal with one "live" stitch at a time; if you drop your hook, the whole project won't unravel instantly. 
                Knitting, by contrast, requires managing dozens of open loops across two needles, which demands a bit more dexterity and a steeper initial learning curve. 
                However, many find that once the muscle memory for knitting kicks in, the rhythmic pace is more meditative, whereas crochet can involve more complex hook placements.

            <p>
                You don't need a craft store's entire inventory to begin. Here are the "must-haves" for a beginner:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Knitting Needles - A size US 8 (5mm) is a very beginner friendly size to work with most budget yarns, material is important for needles and wood often provides a more textured surface for beginners</li>
                <li>Yarn - Any yarn can work but a worsted medium weight (Weight 4 on the package) will work ideally with the above needles</li>
                <li>Scissors - Helpful to cut loose strands and end projects</li>
                <li>Tapestry Needle - These are large, blunt needles that are used for weaving in the ends of your project to remove loose threads</li>
                <li>Stitch Rings - These are small plastic rings that you can slide on the needles between a stitch to mark locations or counts</li>
            </ol>
